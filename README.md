# Landing-page-version2
I did my own version and put notes throughout to better write my code be more effective


So i would like to think @Luna-dev cause I used his landing page code for example. I thought it was very clean on how he created the landing page. 

I created my own version of the project based off his code and broke down each section so that it's easier to understand the HTML and CSS sections and whats doing what in the code. 

If anyone else wants to use this example be my guest it's not perfect but I do feel this helped me make sense of the code and make it cleaner.
